## About
An open-source program inspired in 'Game Maker' for <b>Pygame/Python</b> development.<br/> 
The goal is to have a program to design your own games using easy-to-learn and different easy tools for beginners.<br/>    
When you become more experienced, you will have the possibilities of writing and editing your game with the full flexibility given by <b>Python/Pygame</b>.<br/>    
You are free to distribute the games you create with <b>Stellar</b> in any way you like. You can even sell them.<br/>
This of course assumes that the sprites, images, and sounds you use can be distributed or sold as well.
